Let's get an agents.md file started, or copilot instructions if that works better. First and foremost, no git actions will be taken by copilot, only the human will do git operations.
This is a webassebly blazor PWA app that will track a game called cardio tennis's scoring. It will be a simple app with only browser local storage, and will be depeployed statically. I will explain how the game scoring works but let's start with a md file for you and other agents to see

----------

yes, proceed. are you sure contributing.md is the preferred file name?

----------

Add the agent file, not the human contributing file.

----------

The user will be the coach/faciitator of the cardio tennis session. The user is not a player. There is no login of any kind--everything is local.

The user will click on something that says "New Session". It probably won't be available if a session is already in progress.

The user will select the number of courts and players. You can have a minimum of four and a maximim of eight players to a court. (future feature: be able to add players after or during the match as late players arrive.)

The user will be instructed to have players count off, each saying and remembering their number. (future feature: Be able to add names to player numbers, possibly in advance, possibly when calling off numbers)

The system will randomly* set teams and court assignments for the first match. It will balance the number of players per team so that the difference between the largest and smallest team can only be 1.

*"Randomly" may not be the right term, as we want to mix the teams as much as possible so everyone plays with everyone equally, OR we mix players based on win/loss to try to make fair/competitive/fun matches. We may need to build or find a simple algorithm that can do this. It would probably be based on x matches per hour, so we may also need to ask how long the session is (1, 1.5, or 2 hours are common).

The first match will be played, and scored as follows:

1. App will show each court and user will select the winning team.
2. Each player on each winning team will be awarded a point.

Scores for all players will be displayed. App will select the players and teams for the next match, and the process will repeat until the session is completed, where the final scores will be displayed.

Those are the basics. feel free to re-word or ask questions. It is a very simple app and cardio tennis is mostly for fun.

----------

I missed something. Teams stay together for three matches at a time. Winners play winners and losers play losers twice by teams switching courts, in a pattern known as "up and down the ladder". Winners move up (toward court 1), losers move down (toward court x).  If there is only one court, the teams just play three matches.  After these three matches is when new teams are assembled.

----------

The three matches can be cut short at any time. You will always have a winner and loser for a match, but you might only have two matches played before re-assigning teams. So after each match, the user should be able to indicate if they want to continue with the current teams for another match, or re-assign teams for a new match.

Also, when initial teams are drawn for the first set of matches (only), the user should be able to re-draw teams if they don't like the initial assignment.

Also, if not specified already, there should be an end session button that will end the session and show final scores.

----------

Let's start with a quick, hello world blazor PWA app with local storage.

Then let's focus on getting it deployed and deployments working. I intent to use GitHub pages for static hosting.

So quick blazor PWA hello world with local storage, then deployment to GitHub pages (or instructions for the human if needed).

----------

From READMEL Visit: http://localhost:5000
This is not loading. This appears to the the incorrect port.

----------

The deployment was sucessful, and I see the page on GH Pages. What I do not see is the PWA functionality. The screen shows all green checkmarks for PWA status, so what do we need to do to troubleshoot?

----------

Error in last deployment attempt:

Run sed -i 's/const base = "\/";/const base = "\/CardioTennisPWA\/";/g' publish/wwwroot/service-worker.published.js
sed: can't read publish/wwwroot/service-worker.published.js: No such file or directory
Error: Process completed with exit code 2.

----------

deployed successfully. I see a service worker, but it has errors, which are the same errors I see in the console:

Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://psandler.github.io/CardioTennisPWA/index.html' with computed SHA-256 integrity 'NA2YlK9LCTDvYzSWbWtFrttuAchkg3opclsF3kDuPwU='. The resource has been blocked.Understand this error

    at service-worker.js:28:54
    at async onInstall (service-worker.js:28:5)

----------

I rolled back your most recent changes. I don't like the solution you implemented, which was "remove the integrity check for index.html from the service worker assets manifest."

Let's find another way to change the base href by environment. If this can be done with a config file (or files) that get swapped at build time, that would be a better solution.

----------

Answer the question: did you just implement the same solution I just told you I didn't like? What are the material differences between the changes you just made and the original solution that I rejected? Will a config-based approach not work? No code changes. 

----------

"Would you like me to implement a true config-based approach using one of the options above?"

Yes, and I have rolled your changes back again, so start fresh with a config-based approach.

----------

This runs locally, but I don't see the PWA install functionality. When I try the deployed version I get nothing but 404 errrors:

GET https://psandler.github.io/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
GET https://psandler.github.io/manifest.webmanifest 404 (Not Found)

----------

Deployment now works again, but still no PWA install functionality. Here are the errors, which seem to be the same:

Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource 'https://psandler.github.io/CardioTennisPWA/app-config.js' with computed SHA-256 integrity 'TY5N4/1SGUoCKO/qOKYsSdyh62x7xmDxxE6lTzs8Lb0='. The resource has been blocked.Understand this error

    at service-worker.js:30:54
    at async onInstall (service-worker.js:30:5)

----------

Would this be a better approach than what you just did? Give me the pros and cons. Have we already tried this approach?

"Generate app-config.js before the service worker assets manifest is built. For example, have your MSBuild logic or a pre-publish step:

Copy/transform app-config.Release.js → app-config.js.

Then run the publish / SW manifest generation.

Now the hash in service-worker-assets.js is for the actual deployed file."

No code changes.

----------

Let's do this: "Try the pre-publish approach! It's architecturally cleaner and lets integrity checks work properly."
Latest changes are committed, so you will need to undo what you did in the last prompt yourself.
