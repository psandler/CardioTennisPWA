## Human Notes
- This file and `PromptHistory.txt` were the only files manually created or edited by a human in this project.
- My main focus was on prompting and testing. 
- I did *some* code review, but my focus was on ensuring that the system works/meets requirements.
- All testing was manual. Tested on Chrome in Windows and on an iPhone SE; on the SE it was tested both as a regular web app and as an installed PWA.

### Agent

- Copilot Chat in Visual Studio 2026	
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the model
- I used the same Copilot chat window for the entire project. I did not clear or (best I could tell) lose context, even with a six week break.

### PromptHistory.txt

- This is the complete prompt history for the project. All the code and documentation was generated from these prompts. I have not edited or removed any prompts, except as noted below.
	- There were a few cases where had to re-prompt due to technical issues (e.g., a frozen chat). In those cases, I have omitted the re-prompts.
	- I also used a "side chat" (ChatGPT Desktop) when I needed answers to high-level questions. I did not record those interactions.
- Each sent prompt is separated by a row of dashes ("-----").
- Commit boundaries do not necessarily align with prompt boundaries.
