## Human Notes
- This file, `PromptHistory.txt`, and a small part of `README.md` will be the only files manually created or edited by a human in this project. My goal is to be as low/no-touch as possible, mainly focusing on requirements, architecture, and testing.
- I plan to do *some* code review, but my focus will be on ensuring that it works/meets requirements.
- For the first cut, testing will be done 100% manually by me.

### Agent

- Copilot Chat in Visual Studio 2026	
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the model
- I used the same Copilot chat window for the entire project. I did not clear or (best I could tell) lose context, even with a six week break.

### PromptHistory.txt

- This is the complete prompt history for the project. All the code and documentation was generated from these prompts. I have not edited or removed any prompts, except as noted below.
	- There were a few cases where had to re-prompt due to technical issues (e.g., a frozen chat). In those cases, I have omitted the re-prompts.
	- I also used a "side chat" (ChatGPT Desktop) when I needed answers to high-level questions. I did not record those prompts.
- Each sent prompt is separated by a row of dashes ("-----").
- Commit boundaries do not necessarily align with prompt boundaries.
